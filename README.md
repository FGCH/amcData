---

This repository contains data for the project **Building Better Bad Banks**. 

It includes the full source code and many of the source files used to construct our data set.

## Analysis Data Files Replication

If you download the repository you can use **R** (we used version 2.15.2) to recreate the data sets we use in the analyses with the `makeAMCData.R` file. It is in the *Source/DataCreation* folder.
