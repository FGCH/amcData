# Data for the Project: Building Better Bad Banks

Mark Hallerberg & Christopher Gandrud

---

This repository contains data for the project **Building Better Bad Banks**. 

It includes the full source code and many of the source files used to construct our data set.

## Analysis Data Files Replication

If you download the repository you can use **R** (we used version 2.15.3) to recreate the data sets we use in the analyses with the `makefile`. It is in the *SourceCode/DataCreation/CleanIndividualData* folder.


## Data Visualisations

We are building a series of visualisations that will make this data easier to navigate and understanding. They can be found at:
