This repository contains data for the project **Building Better Bad Banks**. 

It includes the full source code and many of the source files used to construct our data set.

If you download the repository you can use **R** (we used version 2.15.1) to recreate the data sets with the `makeAMCData.R` file in the *Source/DataCreation* folder.
